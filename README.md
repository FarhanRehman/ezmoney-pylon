#### EzMoney - Pylon

**EzMoney** is a simple Currency System for Discord, written using **Typescript** and [Pylon](https://pylon.bot).

There are many commands in the currency system, and it is similar to [Dank Memer's Currency System.](https://dankmemer.lol)

The default prefix for the system is `.`, however you can change it to your liking through the code.
